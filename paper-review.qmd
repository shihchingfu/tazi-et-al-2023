## Summary

- A brief overview of Gaussian Processes and their pros/cons.
- Ten step framework for setting up a "robust and well-specified" model.
- Case study of interpolating glacial elevation data collected by satellites over Greenland.
- A engineering technical manual rather than a mathematical treatise.

# Strengths \& Limitations of GPs

## Takeaways for Me

## Caveats

- Names limitations but doesn't provide much guidance about what to do
- Says not suited to Non-Gaussian distributions ?!
- Need more details on "scaling structures"
- Case Study is doesn't demonstrate the Framework fully
- A bit light on guidance and citations for kernel design
- Really good bibliography of GP literature
- Python code is provided
- No real measure of robust or well-specified model.
